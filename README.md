# PracticeMovieApp
A movie-related app built with SwiftUI fetches movie data from a publicly available API. Users need to create an account to access the app, with an option to sign in using Google. The app allows users to add movies to their watchlist, and customize the appâ€™s theme and language, and stores all user data in Firebase.
